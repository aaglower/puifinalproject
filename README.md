I’ve always loved the idea of opening a restaurant named “Your Mom’s House” or “YMH” that popped up in different locations and featured cuisine that felt homey and like it was made by mom, with a luxurious spin on it. Each chef would be an expert in that specific cuisine and directly pull from dishes they had in their childhood. I created a website for this restaurant and it is able to properly convey the idea and all the information someone might need since the restaurant will have a different menu at each location and will pop up at specific dates and times.
